# SVM-Fruit-Image-Classifier
A classifier that applied SVM to classify images

This is a case study in a lecture. We are required to build a classifier that is able to distinguish different images by using machine learning techniques. Once can the python script and corresponding report in pdf. 

Please note that I do not finish this project all by myself, it is a group work of 5 people.
