# SVM-Fruit-Image-Classifier
A classifier that applied SVM to classify images

This is a case study in a lecture. We are required to build a classifier that is able to distinguish different images by using machine learning techniques. Once can the python script and corresponding report in pdf. 
Please note that I do not finish this project all by myself, it is a group work of 5 people.

In order to test the script, it is necessary to download the following tools and libraries.
Steps to install everything:
1. Download python 3.6.1
2. pip install Sklearn
3. pip install wheel
4. Download Visual Studio 2015 Build tools
5. Download .whl files (numpy-1.13.1+mkl-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64)
6. Install with pip from local directory
7. pip install skimage
